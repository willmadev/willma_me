              Information, and Technology (CCIT) at the University of Toronto

              With two internships under my belt and a growing portfolio, I'm on
              the lookout for new software engineering intern opportunities.

              website. I'm excited about the potential in the tech industry and
              am open to new collaborations and ideas. Feel free to connect with
              me via social media â€“ I'm always eager to explore new horizons.
